    "## Density Matrix Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how the cost function is computed for the autoencoder, we will need to describe our system in terms of density matricies. Density matrices are useful because they describe ensemble behavior of quantum experiments - which are often the result of imperfect quantum manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point in ES170 we have dealt only with pure states - where the quantum state of the system inputs and outputs can be described by a single state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we can have states which are a probablilistic ensemble of pure states. Note that this is fundamentally different from a superposition. We will explore describe this distinction explicitly below. Density matrices are a useful tool for describing this more general class of ensemble states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples will illustrate the mechanics of density matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a pure state, $|\\psi>$ the density matrix (sometimes called the density operator) is given by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho = |\\psi><\\psi|$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single bit system, expressed in the $\\{|0>,|1>\\}$ basis, the density matrix elements are thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho_{11} = <0|\\rho|0>$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho_{12} = <0|\\rho|1>$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho_{21} = <1|\\rho|0>$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho_{12} = <1|\\rho|1>$\n",
    "\n",
    "With some simple dirac manipulation, we can see that the entries of the density matrix are probabilities. For example, $\\rho_{11}$ is the probability of measuring $|\\psi>$ in state zero.\n",
    "\n",
